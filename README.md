# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining  software products. 
Software engineering has helped in the development of softwares used in the healthcare, automotive, communication, commercial, and entertainment industries making work easier and a little faster  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages eg Fortran and C.
In the 1960s Software Development was established as a discipline.
The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s and the advent of structured programming in the 1970s. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(hint:RDITDM)
Requirement:Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: creating a high-level and detailed design for software architecture and user interface 
Implementing: writing code to build the software according to the design.
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment: releasing or hosting the software for users or customers.
Management: Providing support, updates, and enhancement after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
